# BudgetTool:

For our final group project Brandon and I decided to create a budgeting tool for someone of our age group. We hope our tool will be useful for someone trying analyze and alter their current spending habits. The user inputs their purchases for a period of time and our calculator will generate a running sum for each category. Our bugeting tool will output spending percentages for each category so the user can see the impact of high spending in particular categories. We specifically included the categories "coffee" and "alchohol" so thse wouldnt get wrapped up in the "food" category.
